Problem Statement ID: CS05TS Team Name:[Kittens Can Code] College Name: [St Aloysius(Deemed to be University)-AIMIT]
Road accident victims often face critical delays in emergency response due to slow notification and lack of real-time location tracking.

## Proposed Solution
A web-based emergency portal that allows bystanders or victims to trigger an instant GPS-tagged alert to the nearest ambulance and hospital.

## Innovation & Creativity
Our solution uses [e.g., automated location sharing / one-tap alerts] to bypass traditional, slow phone-call dispatch systems.

## Technical Complexity & Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend/Database:** Supabase/Firebase (for real-time alerts)
* **Version Control:** GitHub

## Usability & Impact
Target users include road accident victims and EMS providers. Impact: Reducing response time by up to 50%.
