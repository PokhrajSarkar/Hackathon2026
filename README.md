## ## Problem Statement
Road accident victims often face life-threatening delays ("The Golden Hour") due to slow notification systems and the difficulty of communicating precise GPS locations to emergency responders during high-stress situations.

## ## Proposed Solution
**RescueLink** is a lightweight, one-tap web portal that bypasses traditional call centers. It allows bystanders or victims to send instant, location-verified alerts directly to EMS providers with zero friction.

## ## Key Features
* **One-Tap SOS:** Uses the Browser Geolocation API to lock GPS coordinates instantly.
* **Smart Context Form:** (Current Work-in-Progress) Allows victims to specify the emergency type (Crash, Medical, Fire) and provide their name for responders.
* **Progress Tracking:** Real-time visual feedback to keep the user calm while help is being dispatched.
* **Zero-Install:** Works on any mobile browser—critical for emergencies where every second counts.

## ## Technical Complexity & Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & Tailwind CSS (for rapid, responsive UI)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (Geolocation API)
* **Version Control:** GitHub (Web Interface Workflow)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## ## Usability & Impact
* **Target Users:** Accident victims, bystanders, and EMS dispatchers.
* **Impact:** By automating location sharing, we aim to reduce emergency response times by 30-50%, directly saving lives.

## ## Setup Instructions
1. Visit the live link provided above on any smartphone or modern web browser.
2. Grant "Location Access" when prompted to allow the SOS system to function.
