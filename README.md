## ## Problem Statement
Road accident victims often face life-threatening delays ("The Golden Hour") due to slow notification systems and the difficulty of communicating precise GPS locations to emergency responders during high-stress situations.

## ## Proposed Solution
**RescueLink** is a lightweight, one-tap web portal that bypasses traditional call centers. It allows bystanders or victims to send instant, location-verified alerts directly to EMS providers with zero friction.

## ## Key Features
* **One-Tap SOS:** Uses the Browser Geolocation API to lock GPS coordinates instantly.
* **Two-Stage Emergency Flow:** Separates location locking from data entry to ensure coordinates are captured even if the user is interrupted.
* **Contextual Dispatch:** Collects User Name and Emergency Type (Road Accident, Medical, Fire) to better inform First Responders.
* **Live UI State Management:** Seamlessly transitions between SOS, Data Entry, and Success states without refreshing the page.
* **Zero-Install:** Works on any mobile browser—critical for emergencies where every second counts.

## ## Technical Complexity & Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & Tailwind CSS (for rapid, responsive UI)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (Geolocation API)
* **Version Control:** GitHub (Web Interface Workflow)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## ## Usability & Impact
* **Target Users:** Accident victims, bystanders, and EMS dispatchers.
* **Impact:** By automating location sharing and context gathering, we aim to reduce emergency response times by 30-50%, directly saving lives.

## ## Setup Instructions
1. Visit the live link provided above on any smartphone or modern web browser.
2. Grant "Location Access" when prompted to allow the SOS system to function.
3. Once location is captured, fill in the emergency details and click "Confirm & Dispatch."
